🏰 KeeperFX Custom Map

This is a custom Map for KeeperFX. Please note: It requires the latest Alpha version of KeeperFX to run correctly.

📦 Installation Instructions

1.Click the green “Code” button at the top of this page.

2.Select “Download ZIP” and extract the contents to a temporary folder.

Unfortunately, GitHub places all files into an extra folder, which KeeperFX cannot read directly.

3.Open that folder and locate the following 5 files:

easter_egg

easter_egg_cfg

easter_egg_crt

easter_egg_media

easter_egg.cfg

4.Move all 5 files into the following directory in your KeeperFX installation: -KeeperFX/levels

Launch KeeperFX and your Map should now be available to play!
